# sorting Introduction
- Callbacks: 
    - a callback, also known as a "call-after" function, is any executable code that is passed as an argument to other code; that other code is expected to call back (execute) the argument at a given time. 
    - This mechanism allows the sorting of any type of data. 
    - In Java, we use interfaces to implement it.
    
# Selection Sort
- In iteration i, find index min of the smallest remaining entry.
- Swap a[i] and a[min].
